                    In Buddhism, the concept of the mindstream refers to the
                    continuous flow of thoughts, emotions, and experiences that
                    make up an individual's consciousness.

                    It is believed to be something that is intangible and
                    incorporeal, and it is seen as being the repository of an
                    individual's actions and experiences.

                    In some schools of Buddhism, the mindstream is seen as being
                    closely connected to the concept of Karma, which is the idea
                    that our actions have consequences, and that the things that
                    happen to us in our lives are a result of the things we have
                    done in the past.

                    the future.
